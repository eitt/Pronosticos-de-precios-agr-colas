abstract = {T he battle between proponents of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis and champions of be- havioral finance has never been more pitched, and little consensus exists as to which side is winning or the implications for investment management and con- sulting. In this article, I review the case for and against the Efficient Markets Hypothesis and describe a new framework—the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis—in which the traditional models of modern financial eco- nomics can coexist alongside behavioral models in an intellectually consistent manner. Based on evolutionary principles, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis implies that the degree of market efficiency is related to envi- ronmental factors characterizing market ecology such as the number of competitors in the market, the magni- tude of profit opportunities available, and the adapt- ability of the market participants. Many of the examples that behavioralists cite as violations of rationality that are inconsistent with market efficiency—loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases—are, in fact, consistent with an evolutionary model of individuals adapting to a chang- ing environment via simple heuristics. Despite the qual- itative nature of this new paradigm, I show that the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis yields a number of sur- prisingly concrete applications for both investment managers and consultants.},

The class of fractional GARCH models, namely the FIGARCH model of Baillie et al.

(1993). The estimated d parameters, indicating long-term dependence, suggest that fractional integration is found in most of agricultural commodity futures returns series.

The modifications do not cause serious size distortions or power deterioration in the white noise case. While studies in the literature have investigated the operating characteristics of these tests in the presence of moving average errors, of particular concern in this paper is the performance of these procedures in the presence of autoregressive errors. The Philips and Perron (1988) and Choi and Philips (1991) procedures are found to suffer from serious size distortions and have very low power when errors are autoregressively correlated. We conclude that even in the most favorable cases, these tests perform poorly against trend-stationary alternatives which are plausible for annual, quarterly, and monthly macroeconomic time series. The augmented Dickey-Fuller procedure, on the other hand, is reasonably well-behaved. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

A better model fit results from allowing the unconditional variance to slowly change over time. Moreover, the persistence of volatility shocks is shown to be much weaker than what standard GARCH models imply. Combining the volatility results with monthly macroeconomic indicator data, we find that decomposing realized volatility into high- and low-frequency components better reveals the impact of slowly-evolving aggregate variables on price volatility. Moreover, over the period 1990–2005, most of the macroeconomic variables had similar effects within the same commodity category (e.g. grain), but their effects differed across commodity groups (e.g. grain versus livestock). Over the period 2006–2009, however, commodity-specific factors dominated common factors.},

abstract = {There has been substantial research effort aimed to forecast futures price return volatilities of financial and commodity assets. Some part of this research focuses on the performance of time-series models (in particular ARCH models) versus option implied volatility models. A significant part of the literature re- lated to this topic shows that volatility forecast accuracy is not easy to estimate regardless of the forecasting model applied. This paper examines the volatility accuracy of volatility forecast models for the case of corn and wheat futures price returns. The models applied here are a univariate GARCH, a multivari- ate ARCH (the BEKK model), an option implied and a composite forecast model. The composite model includes time-series (historical) and option im- plied volatility forecasts. The results show that the option implied model is superior to the historical models in terms of accuracy and that the composite forecast model was the most accurate one (compared to the alternative models) having the lowest mean-square-errors. Given these findings it is recommended to use a composite forecast model if both types of data are available i.e. the time-series (historical) and the option implied. In addition, the results of this paper are consistent to that part of the literature that emphasizes the difficulty on being accurate about forecasting asset price return volatility. This is because the explanatory power (coefficient of determination) calculated in the forecast regressions were relatively low.},

In the present paper these bounds are tabulated and their use in practice is described. For cases in which the bounds do not settle the question of significance an approximate method is sug- gested. Expressions are given for the mean and variance of a test statistic for one- and two-way classifications and polynomial trends, leading to approximate tests for these cases. The procedures described should be capable of application by the practical worker without reference to the earlier paper (hereinafter referred to as Part I). It should be emphasized that the tests described in this paper apply only to regression models in which the independent variables can be regarded as fixed variables'. They do not, therefore, apply to autoregressive schemes and similar models in which lagged values of the dependent variable occur as independent variables.},

The main conclusion will be that the data seem to present consistent and strong support for the model. This implies, of course, that chart reading, though perhaps an interesting pastime, is of no real value to the stock market investor. This is an extreme statement and the chart reader is certainly free to take exception. Since the empirical evidence produced by this and other studies in support of the random-walk model is now so voluminous, the counterarguments of the chart reader will be completely lacking in force if they are not equally well supported by empirical work. By contrast the stock market trader has a much more practical criterion for judging what constitutes important dependence in successive price changes. For his purposes the random walk model is valid as long, as knowledge of the past behavior of the series of price changes cannot be used to increase expected gains. More specifically, the independence assumption is an adequate description of reality as long as the actual degree of dependence in the series of price changes is not sufficient to allow the past history of the series to be used to predict the future in a way, which makes expected profits greater than they would be under a naive buy-and-hold model.},

Findings suggest that none of the four major stock markets of south-Asia follows Random-walk and hence all these markets are not the weak form of efficient market.
